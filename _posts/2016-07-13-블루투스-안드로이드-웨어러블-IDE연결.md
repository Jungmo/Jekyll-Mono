Enable Debugging over Bluetooth. You should see a tiny status summary appear under the option:
Host: disconnected
Target: connected

Connect the handheld to your machine over USB and run:

adb forward tcp:4444 localabstract:/adb-hub
adb connect localhost:4444

**Note: You can use any available port that you have access to.**

In the Android Wear companion app, you should see the status change to:

Host: connected
Target: connected
