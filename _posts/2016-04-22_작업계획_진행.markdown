## How to solve lack of memory for comparing two images?

Use not compare function in opencv but binary diff. Size of one image is 41kb so that i will divide a image by 2 kb. Then, there is 2 file stream which is comparing one and criterion one. use binary diff and count how many each couples of octect is different between comparing and criterion.
Eliminate bmp header for reducing computation.
